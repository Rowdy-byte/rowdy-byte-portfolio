## Introduction

As you might have guessed, my name is Rowdy, and I am 41 years young.

## A Bit of History

I've always been a creative and curious person. As a child, I spent a lot of time drawing, crafting, and writing. I made membership cards for imaginary libraries and Super Mario cards for my classmates. Back then, I didn’t have a computer, so everything I designed was handmade. I had beautiful handwriting, which surprised people because I was often told it looked more like a girl’s or woman’s handwriting.

As I got older, I got my first personal computer. I’ll never forget it—it was a Compaq Presario with a 333MHz processor. Proudly, I told my computer science teacher in middle school that I had a "333." It was the fastest processor at the time, and he was amazed! I began learning about computers, quickly becoming familiar with the components and what they did. I even replaced the video card and installed a DVD player that could also write DVDs. A friend of mine used to give me Twilight DVDs, each containing the latest software and games. But while others were playing games, I was more curious about how everything worked.

## Curiosity

How did this beautiful menu pop up when I put the DVD in the player? How did all the titles appear in the menu, and when I clicked on one, an article loaded in another section? My curiosity led me to dig into the hidden files and folders, where I discovered that the menu was simply a text document with code. I downloaded all the files from the DVD to my computer, started changing values, and watched the menu change. Before long, I was creating my own menus. I also collected as many cracks and patches as I could find and made my own DVD.

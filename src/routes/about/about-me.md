    ## Introduction

    So as you might already quessed my name is Rowdy!

    I've always been a very creative person. When I was a child I was always drawing, crafting &
    writing. I was making member cards for non existing library's & Super Marion member card. Back
    then I didn't had a computer so everythin I designed was handmade.

    When I got older I had my first personal computer. I will never forget this computer. It was a
    Compaq Presario 333Mhz processor.

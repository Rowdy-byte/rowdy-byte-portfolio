## Introduction

As you might have guessed, my name is Rowdy, and I am 41 years young.

## Brief History

I've always been a creative and curious person. As a child, I spent a lot of time drawing, crafting, and writing. I made membership cards for imaginary libraries and Super Mario cards for my classmates. Back then, I didn’t have a computer, so everything I designed was handmade. I had beautiful handwriting, which surprised people because I was often told it looked more like a girl’s or woman’s handwriting.

<br>

As I got older, I got my first personal computer. I’ll never forget it—it was a Compaq Presario with a 333MHz processor. Proudly, I told my computer science teacher in middle school that I had a "333." It was the fastest processor at the time, and he was amazed! I began learning about computers, quickly becoming familiar with the components and what they did. I even replaced the video card and installed a DVD player that could also write DVDs. A friend of mine used to give me Twilight DVDs, each containing the latest software and games. But while others were playing games, I was more curious about how everything worked.

## Curiosity

How did this beautiful menu pop up when I put the DVD in the player? How did all the titles appear in the menu, and when I clicked on one, an article loaded in another section? My curiosity led me to dig into the hidden files and folders, where I discovered that the menu was simply a text document with code. I downloaded all the files from the DVD to my computer, started changing values, and watched the menu change. Before long, I was creating my own menus. I also collected as many cracks and patches as I could find and made my own DVD.

## Path of Life

I never really had the nerve to turn my hobby into a job. I didn’t know how. I’ve held many different jobs, but I never experienced that feeling of “this is what I can do for the rest of my life”. I made some mistakes along the way, but hey, we’re all here to learn, right? In the meantime, I spent a lot of my free time behind the computer, writing stories and rhymes, learning 3D modeling, and building computers.

## Coding

About three years ago, I really started to learn web development. I began with HTML5 and CSS3, which I picked up fairly quickly. However, building a full-blown website from scratch is another matter entirely. How do I get the right alignment between elements? Which font should I choose? What about colors, line height, and letter spacing? Web development can become overwhelming pretty quickly. I haven’t even mentioned JavaScript yet.

<br>
<br>

## Js

JavaScript is kind of… well, I found it challenging to learn. In the beginning, I avoided it because I didn’t have the confidence that I could ever wrap my head around it. I learn quickly by visualizing things, but with JavaScript, I struggled to visualize it. Basic variable assignments or creating simple arrays and objects weren’t too hard. However, writing pure functions, understanding asynchronous code, callbacks, promises, and closures proved to be much more difficult.

<br>
<br>

## Bad Marriage

The struggle was / is real. Many times, I left JavaScript behind and started learning Ruby instead. I even got my feet wet with Ruby on Rails. Using the Rails CLI, I could set up a basic frontend and backend with authentication in just a few commands. This helped me understand the structure of a full-stack app and the MVC pattern. But I didn’t want to rely on setting up projects with a few commands—I wanted a deeper understanding of how everything worked.

<br>
<br>

So, back to my love-hate relationship with JavaScript: I wanted to know how to get a basic full-stack app running with JavaScript. For a while, I was hopping from one framework or library to another, often without finishing anything. After some so-called "tutorial hell", I finally made up my mind about which framework clicked with me the most—SvelteKit.

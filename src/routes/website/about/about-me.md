<h2 class="about__heading">Brief History</h2>

<p class="about__paragraph">I've always been a creative and curious person. As a child, I spent a lot of time <span class="drawing__span">drawing</span>, <span class="crafting__span">crafting</span>, and <span class="writing__span">writing</span>. I made membership cards for imaginary libraries and Super Mario cards for my classmates. Back then, I didn’t have a computer, so everything I designed was handmade. I had beautiful handwriting, which surprised people because I was often told it looked more like a girl’s or woman’s handwriting.</p>

<br>

<p class="about__paragraph">As I got older, I got my first personal computer. I’ll never forget it—it was a <span class="compaq__span sky">Compaq Presario</span> with a <span class="mhz__span">333Mhz</span> processor. Proudly, I told my computer science teacher in middle school that I had a "333". It was the fastest processor at the time, and he was amazed! I began learning about computers, quickly becoming familiar with the components and what they did. I even replaced the video card and installed a <span class="dvd__span">DVD</span> player that could also write DVDs. A friend of mine used to give me Twilight DVDs, each containing the latest software and games. But while others were playing games, I was more curious about how everything worked.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h2 class="about__heading">Curiosity</h2>

<p class="about__paragraph">How did this beautiful menu pop up when I put the DVD in the player? How did all the titles appear in the menu, and when I clicked on one, an article loaded in another section? My curiosity led me to dig into the hidden <span class="files__span">files</span> and <span class="folders__span">folders</span>, where I discovered that the menu was simply a text document with code. I downloaded all the files from the <span class="dvd__span sky">DVD</span> to my computer, started changing values, and watched the menu change. Before long, I was creating my own menus. I also collected as many cracks and patches as I could find and made my own DVD.</p>

<h2 class="about__heading">Path of Live</h2>

<p class="about__paragraph">I never really had the nerve to turn my hobby into a job. I didn’t know how. I’ve held many different jobs, but I never experienced that feeling of “this is what I can do for the rest of my life”. I made some mistakes along the way, but hey, we’re all here to learn, right? In the meantime, I spent a lot of my free time behind the computer, writing stories and rhymes, learning 3D modeling with <span class="sketchup__span">Sketchup</span> and <span class="vray__span">V-RAY</span>, and building computers.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h2 class="about__heading yellow">Coding</h2>

<p class="about__paragraph">About three years ago, I really started to learn web development. I began with <span class="html__span">HTML5</span> and <span class="css__span">CSS3</span>, which I picked up fairly quickly. However, building a full-blown website from scratch is another matter entirely. How do I get the right alignment between elements? Which font should I choose? What about colors, line height, and letter spacing? Web development can become overwhelming pretty quickly. I haven’t even mentioned <span class="javascript__span">JavaScript</span> yet.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h2 class="about__heading text orna">JS</h2>

<p class="about__paragraph"><span class="javascript__span">JavaScript</span> is kind of… well, I found it challenging to learn. In the beginning, I avoided it because I didn’t have the confidence that I could ever wrap my head around it. I learn quickly by visualizing things, but with <span class="javascript__span">JavaScript</span>, I struggled to visualize it. Basic variable assignments or creating simple arrays and objects weren’t too hard. However, writing pure functions, understanding asynchronous code, callbacks, promises, and closures proved to be much more difficult.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h2 class="about__heading">Bad Marriage</h2>

<p class="about__paragraph yell">The struggle was / is real. Many times, I left <span class="javascript__span">JavaScript</span> behind and started learning <span class="ruby__span">Ruby</span> instead. I even got my feet wet with <span class="rails__span">Ruby on Rails</span>. Using the Rails <span class="cli__span">CLI</span>, I could set up a basic frontend and backend with authentication in just a few commands. This helped me understand the structure of a full-stack app and the <span class="mvc__span">MVC</span> pattern. But I didn’t want to rely on setting up projects with a few commands—I wanted a deeper understanding of how everything worked.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p class="about__paragraph oran">So, back to my love-hate relationship with <span class="mvc__span">MVC</span>: I wanted to know how to get a basic full-stack app running with <span class="javascript__span">JavaScript</span> . For a while, I was hopping from one framework or library to another, often without finishing anything. After some so-called "tutorial hell", I finally made up my mind about which framework clicked with me the most—<span class="svelte__span">SvelteKit</span>.</p>

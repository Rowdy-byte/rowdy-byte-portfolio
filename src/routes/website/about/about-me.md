<h2 class="about__heading">Brief History</h2>

<p class="about__paragraph">I've always been a creative and curious person. As a child, I spent a lot of time <span class="drawing__span tag">drawing</span>, <span class="crafting__span tag">crafting</span>, and <span class="writing__span tag">writing</span>. I made membership cards for imaginary libraries and Super Mario Club membercards for my classmates. Back then, I didn’t have a computer, so everything I designed was handmade. I had beautiful handwriting, which surprised people because I was often told it looked more like a girl’s or woman’s handwriting.</p>

<br>

<p class="about__paragraph">As I got older, I got my first personal computer. I’ll never forget it—it was a <span class="compaq__span tag">Compaq Presario</span> with a <span class="mhz__span tag">333Mhz</span> processor. Proudly, I told my computer science teacher in middle school that I had a &lsquo;333&rsquo;. It was the fastest processor at the time, and he was amazed! I began learning about computers, quickly becoming familiar with the components and what they did. I even replaced the video card and installed a <span class="dvd__span tag">DVD</span> player that could also write DVDs. A friend of mine used to give me Twilight DVDs, each containing the latest software and games. But while others were playing games, I was more curious about how everything worked.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h2 class="about__heading">Curiosity</h2>

<p class="about__paragraph">How did this beautiful menu pop up when I put the DVD in the player? How did all the titles appear in the menu, and when I clicked on one, an article loaded in another section? My curiosity led me to dig into the hidden <span class="files__span tag">files</span> and <span class="folders__span tag">folders</span>, where I discovered that the menu was simply a text document with code. I downloaded all the files from the <span class="dvd__span tag">DVD</span> to my computer, started changing values, and watched the menu change. Before long, I was creating my own menus. I also collected as many cracks and patches as I could find and made my own DVD.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h2 class="about__heading">Path of Life</h2>

<p class="about__paragraph">I never really had the nerve to turn my hobby into a job. I didn’t know how. I’ve held many different jobs, but I never experienced that feeling of “this is what I can do for the rest of my life”. I made some mistakes along the way, but hey, we’re all here to learn, right? In the meantime, I spent a lot of my free time behind the computer, writing stories and rhymes, learning 3D modeling with <span class="sketchup__span tag">Sketchup</span> and <span class="vray__span tag">V-RAY</span>, and building computers.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h2 class="about__heading yellow">Coding</h2>

<p class="about__paragraph">About three years ago, I really started to learn web development. I began with <span class="html__span tag">HTML5</span> and <span class="css__span tag">CSS3</span>, which I picked up fairly quickly. However, building a full-blown website from scratch is another matter entirely. How do I get the right alignment between elements? Which font should I choose? What about colors, line height, and letter spacing? Web development can become overwhelming pretty quickly. I haven’t even mentioned <span class="javascript__span tag">JavaScript</span> yet.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h2 class="about__heading">JS</h2>

<p class="about__paragraph"><span class="javascript__span tag">JavaScript</span> is kind of… well, I found it challenging to learn. In the beginning, I avoided it because I didn’t have the confidence that I could ever wrap my head around it. I learn quickly by visualizing things, but with <span class="javascript__span tag">JavaScript</span>, I struggled to visualize it. Basic variable <span class="brackets__span tag">=</span> assignments or creating simple <span class="brackets__span tag">&lbrack;</span>arrays<span class="brackets__span tag">&rbrack;</span> and <span class="curly__span tag">&lbrace;</span>objects<span class="curly__span tag">&rbrace;</span> weren’t too hard. However, writing pure functions, understanding <span class="async__span tag">async</span>chronous code, <span class="callback__span tag">&lpar;</span><span class="callback__span tag">&lpar;</span>callbacks<span class="callback__span tag">&rpar;</span> <span class="arrow__span tag">&#61; &gt;</span>  <span class="curly__span tag">&lbrace; &rbrace;<span class="callback__span tag">&rpar;</span></span> , promises.<span class="async__span tag">then</span><span class="callback__span tag">&lpar;</span> <span class="callback__span tag">&rpar;</span>, and closures proved to be much more difficult.<span class="brackets__span tag">&lbrack;</span>100<span class="brackets__span tag">&rbrack;</span></p>

<br>
<br>

<h2 class="about__heading">Bad Marriage</h2>

<p class="about__paragraph">The struggle was <span class="curly__span tag">&&</span>  is real. Many times, I left <span class="javascript__span tag">JavaScript</span> behind and started learning <span class="ruby__span tag">Ruby</span> instead. I even got my feet wet with <span class="rails__span tag">Ruby on Rails</span>. Using the Rails <span class="cli__span tag">CLI</span>, I could set up a basic frontend and backend with authentication in just a few commands. This helped me understand the structure of a full-stack app and the <span class="mvc__span tag">MVC</span> pattern. But I didn’t want to rely on setting up projects with a few commands—I wanted a deeper understanding of how everything worked.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p class="about__paragraph">So, back to my love-hate relationship with <span class="javascript__span tag">JavaScript</span>: I wanted to know how to get a basic full-stack app running with <span class="javascript__span tag">JavaScript</span> . For a while, I was hopping from one framework or library to another, often without finishing anything. After some so-called "tutorial hell", I finally made up my mind about which framework clicked with me the most—<span class="svelte__span tag">SvelteKit</span>.</p>

<br>

<h2 class="about__heading">Concistency is Key</h2>

<p class="about__paragraph">
During difficult periods while learning the basics, it really helped me to hear stories from other people about how they dealt with challenges, insecurity and the feeling of being stuck while learning <span class="dev__span tag">development</span>. I’m grateful to those amazing people who shared their stories and helped me push through. That’s one of the things I really appreciate about the <span class="javascript__span tag">JavaScript</span> <span class="community__span tag">community</span> and <span class="eco__span tag">ecosystem</span>. I see so many passionate, smart people doing what they love. Almost everything is <span class="open-source__span tag">open-source</span>, making learning <span class="javascript__span tag">JavaScript</span> accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
